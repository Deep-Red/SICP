*Abelson & Sussman, exercises 3.50, 3.51, 3.52, 3.53, 3.54, 3.55, 3.56, 3.64, 3.66, 3.68*

## 3.50

*Complete the following definition, which generalizes `stream-map` to allow procedures that take multiple arguments, analogous to `map` in 2.2.1, Footnote 78.*

```scheme
(define (stream-map proc . argstreams)
  (if (<??> (car argstreams))
    the-empty-stream
    (<??>
      (apply proc (map <??> argstreams))
      (apply stream-map
        (cons proc
          (map <??>
            argstreams))))))
```

```scheme
(define (stream-map proc . argstreams)
  (if (stream-null? (car argstreams))
    the-empty-stream
    (cons-stream
      (apply proc (map (stream-car argstreams)))
      (apply stream-map
        (cons proc
          (map (stream-cdr
            argstreams)))))))
```

## 3.51

*In order to take a closer look at delayed evaluation, we will use the following procedure, which simply returns its argument after printing it:*

```scheme
(define (show x)
  (display-line x)
  x)
```

*What does the interpreter print in response to evaluating each expression in the following sequence?*

```scheme
(define x
  (stream-map
    show
    (stream-enumerate-interval 0 10)))

(stream-ref x 5)
(stream-ref x 7)
```

`0x`  
`1
2
3
4
55`
`6
77`

On subsequent evaluations of `(stream-ref x 5)` the output will simply be `5`.


## 3.52

*Consider the sequence of expressions*

```scheme
(define sum 0)

(define (accum x)
  (set! sum (+ x sum))
  sum)

(define seq
  (stream-map
   accum
   (stream-enumerate-interval 1 20)))

(define y (stream-filter even? seq))

(define z
  (stream-filter
    (lambda (x)
      (= (remainder x 5) 0)) seq))

(stream-ref y 7)
(display-stream z)
```

*What is the value of `sum` after each of the above expressions is evaluated? What is the printed response to evaluating the `stream-ref` and `display-stream` expressions? Would these reponses differ if we had implemented `(delay <exp>)` simply as `(lambda () <exp>)` without using the optimization provided by `memo-proc`? Explain.*

```scheme
0 ; sum is defined as 0
0 ; defining accum does not change the value of sum
1 ; when seq is defined accum is evaluated for the car, adding 1 to sum
6 ; seq generates 1, 3, 6... 6 is the first one that meets the filter test for even?. sum is set to 1, 3, and 6 during this time by the call to accum.
10 ; 10 is the first integer in seq that meets the filter in z.
136 ; stream-ref returns 136, which is equivalent to (stream-ref seq 15)
210 ; accum continues to be called with each successive viewing of the stream seq until it is finally set at the highest called value.
```

Without the memoization sum should be incremented repeatedly, as each time a higher stream-ref of seq is called all previous items would have to be viewed as well.

## 3.53

*Without running the program, describe the elements of the stream defined by `(define s (cons-stream 1 (add-streams s s)))`*

This should be a stream of powers of 2 - 1, 2, 4, 8...

## 3.54

*Define a procedure `mul-streams`, analagous to `add-streams`, that produces the elementwise product of its two input streams. Use this together with the stream of integers to complete the following definition of the stream whose n<sup>nt</sup> element (counting from 0) is n + 1 factorial:*

```scheme
(define factorials
  (cons-stream 1 (mul-streams <??> <??>)))
```

```scheme
(define (mul-streams s1 s2)
  (stream-map * s1 s2))

(define factorials
  (cons-stream 1 (mul-streams integers factorials)))
```
