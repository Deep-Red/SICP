*Abelson & Sussman, exercises 4.3, 4.6, 4.7-, 4.10-, 4.11-, 4.13, 4.14, 4.15
(exercises with a - next to them are optional, but encouraged).*

## 4.3

*Rewrite `eval` so that the dispatch is done in data-directed style. Compare this with the data-directed differentiation procedure of Exercise 2.73. (You may use the `car` of a compound expression as the type of the expression, as is appropriate for the syntax implemented in this section.)*

Using the table manipulation methods defined earlier:
```scheme
(define eval-dd-table (make-table))

(define (populate-eval-dd-table)
  (insert! '(quote) text-of-quotation eval-dd-table)
  (insert! '(set!) eval-assignment eval-dd-table)
  (insert! '(define) eval-definition eval-dd-table)
  (insert! '(if) eval-if eval-dd-table)
  (insert! '(lambda) (lambda (exp env) make-procedure (lambda-parameters exp) (lambda-body exp) env) eval-dd-table)
  (insert! '(begin) (lambda (exp env) (eval-sequence (begin actions exp) env)) eval-dd-table)
  (insert! '(cond) (lambda (exp env) (eval-dd (cond->if exp) env)) eval-dd-table))

(define (eval-dd exp env)
  (cond ((self-evaluating? exp) exp)
    ((variable? exp) (lookup-variable-value exp env))
    ((lookup (list (car exp)) eval-dd-table) ((lookup (list (car exp)) eval-dd-table) exp env))
    ((application? exp) (apply (eval (operator exp) env)))
    (else (error "Unknown expression type -- EVAL" exp))))
```

## 4.6

*Let expressions are derived expressions, because `(let ((<var<sub>1</sub>> <exp<sub>1</sub>>) ... (<var<sub>n</sub>> <exp<sub>n</sub>)) <body>)` is equivalent to `((lambda (<var<sub>1</sub>> ... <var<sub>n</sub>) <body>) <exp<sub>1</sub>> ... <exp<sub>n</sub>)`. Implement a syntactic transformation let->combination that reduces evaluating `let` expressions to evaluating combinations of the type shown above, and add the appropriate clause to `eval` to handle `let` expressions.*

```scheme
(define (let? exp)
  (tagged-list? exp 'let))
(define (let-body exp) (cddr exp))
(define (let-vars exp) (map car (cadr exp)))
(define (let-values exp) (map cadr (cadr exp)))
(define (let->combination exp)
  (cons (make-lambda (let-vars exp) (let-body exp)) (let-values exp)))

;...
((let? exp) (eval (let->combination exp) env))
;...
```

## 4.7

*`Let*` is similar to `let`, except that the bindings of the `let*` variables are performed sequentially from left to right, and each binding is made in an environment in which all of the preceding bindings are visible. For example `(let* ((x 3) (y (+ x 2)) (z (+ x y 5))) (* x z))` returns 39. Explain how a `let*` expression can be rewritten as a set of nested `let` expressions, and write a procedure `let*->nested-lets` that performs this transformation. If we have already implemented `let` (Exercise 4.6) and we want to extend the evaluator to handle `let*`, is it sufficient to add a clause to eval whose action is `(eval (let*->nested-lets exp) env)` or must we explicitly expand `let*` in terms of non-derived expressions?*

```scheme
(define (let*->nested-lets exp)
  (let ((args (let*-args exp) (body (let*-body exp)))
  (define (make-lets exps)
    (if (null? exps?)
      body
      (list 'let (list (car exprs)) (make-lets (cdr exps)))))
  (make-lets args))))
```

I don't think that `(eval (let*-> nested-lets exp) env)` will work on its own. It would construct the correct expression, but that expression would not be passed to the evaluator once it had been made...

## 4.11

*Instead of representing a frame as a pair of lists, we can represent a frame as a list of bindings, where each binding is a name-value pair. Rewrite the environment operations to use this alternative representation.*

```scheme
(define (make-frame variables values)
  (if (null? (cdr variables))
    (list (cons (car variables) (car values)))
    (cons (cons (car variables) (car values)) (make-frame (cdr variables) (cdr values)))))
(define (frame-variables frame)
  (if (null? (cdr frame))
    (caar frame)
    (cons (caar frame) (frame-variables (cdr frame)))))
(define (frame-values frame)
  (if (null? (cdr frame))
    (cdar frame)
    (cons (cdar frame) (frame-values (cdr frame)))))
(define (add-binding-to-frame! var val frame)
  (set-cdr! frame (cons (cons var val) (cdr frame))))
```

## 4.13

*Scheme allows us to create new bindings for variables by means of `define`, but provides no way to get rid of bindings. Implement for the evaluator a special form `make-unbound!` that removes the binding of a given symbol from the environment in which the `make-unbound!` expression is evaluated. This problem is not completely specified. For example, should we remove only the binding in the first frame of the environment? Complete the specification and justify any choices you make.*

```scheme
(define (make-unbound! var env)
  (define (scan vars vals)
    (cond? ((null? vars) (error "Variable not bound" var))
      ((eq? var (cadr vars))
        (set-cdr! vars (cddr vars))
        (set-cdr! vals (cddr vals)))
      (else (scan (cdr vars) (cdr vals)))))
  (let ((frame (first-frame env)))
    (scan (frame-variables frame) (frame-values frame))))
```

This setup of `make-unbound!` only affects the first frame of the current environment, in case other procedures are depending on variables higher up in the chain. I think this is the right decision, based on the fact that PHP treats `unset` in a similar fashion.

## 4.14

*Eva Lu Ator and Louis Reasoner are each experimenting with the metacircular evaluator. Eva types in the definition of `map`, and runs some test programs that use it. They work fine. Louis, in contrast, has installed the system version of `map` as a primitive for the metacircular evaluator. When he tries it, things go terribly wrong. Explain why Louis's `map` fails even though Eva's works.*

When the system version of map is called, it cannot properly interpret the arguments to eval, since they are in a format that is different than the underlying Scheme.

## 4.15

*Given a one-argument procedure `p` and and object `a`, `p` is said to "halt" on `a` if evaluating the expression `(p a)` returns a value (as opposed to terminating with an error message or running forever). Show that it is impossible to write a procedure `halts?` that correctly determines whether `p` halts on `a` for any procedure `p` and object `a`. Use the following reasoning: If you had such a procedure `halts?`, you could implement the following program:*

```scheme
(define (run-forever)
  (run-forever))

(define (try p)
  (if (halts? p p)
    (run-forever)
    'halted))
```

*Now consider evaluating the expression (try try) and show that any possible outcome (either halting or running forever) violates the intended behavior of `halts?`.*

If the inner `try` runs forever, then the outer `try` will return `'halted`, whereas if the inner `try` halts the outer `try` will run forever.
