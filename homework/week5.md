*Abelson & Sussman, exercises 2.24, 2.26, 2.29, 2.30, 2.31, 2.32, 2.36, 2.37, 2.38, 2.54.*

## 2.24

*Suppose we evaluate the expression `(list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4)))`. Give the result printed by the interpreter, the corresponding box-and-pointer structure, and the interpretation of this as a tree (as in figure 2.6).*

`(1 (2 (3 4)))`
